## Hardware

This includes any specific or customized piece of hardware for this application to run.  

### What's in scope?

* Proprietary devices
* Dedicated servers

### Examples

Embedded devices, custom PCBs, GPUs

### Who owns it?

* Operations team
* Cloud provider

### What are the security concerns?

* Hardware devices come with embedded software that is attack vector
* 

### How do I secure it?

* Buy from known supplier 
* Network analysis so you can detect malicious "phone home"
