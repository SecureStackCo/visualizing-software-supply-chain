## Continuous deployment

Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration that automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage. This means that in addition to automated testing, you have an automated release process, and can deploy your application at any time by clicking a button.

### What's in scope?

* Build servers
* Deployment platforms
* Security tests
* Functional tests

### Examples

<img src="images/azure-devops.svg" width="50" height="50" title="Azure DevOps">  <img src="images/jenkins.svg" width="50" height="50" title="Jenkins">  <img src="images/octopus-deploy.svg" width="50" height="50" title="Octopus Deploy"> <img src="images/buildkite.png" width="50" height="50" title="Buildkite">  <img src="images/bamboo.png" width="50" height="50" title="Atlassian Bamboo">

Bamboo, Selenium, Semgrep, SecureStack

### Who owns it?

* CloudOps team
* DevOps team

### What are the security concerns?

* Are disposable build environments secure?
* Are components being used during CI/CD known good? 
* Security scans are automated as part of the deployment process

### How do I secure it?

* Dynamic application security testing
* Static analysis security testing
